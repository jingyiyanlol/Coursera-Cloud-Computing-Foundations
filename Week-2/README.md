1. C​reate a Jupyter Notebook Documentation Project

    U​se Jupyter Notebook to practice repeatable technical documentation skills.  

    The following tasks are to be performed:

    * Create a code cell and print a Python Hello World statement:  
    ```python
    print("hello world")
    ```

    * Create a Markdown Cell and add a Title using # and then a statement using plain text. You can looks at the source code for this cell to get an idea of how to use Markdown.

    * Take some ideas from the [Master Markdown GitHub Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) and implement them.

    * Download [this notebook](https://github.com/noahgift/duke-coursera-ccf-lab1/blob/main/Practice-Markdown.ipynb) as a .ipynb file and check into a GitHub Project. 

    * Open your [notebook in Google Colab](https://github.com/noahgift/duke-coursera-ccf-lab1/blob/main/Practice_Markdown_with_colab.ipynb) and save it into the same GitHub Project.
